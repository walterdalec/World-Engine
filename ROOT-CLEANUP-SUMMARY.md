**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Commit**: `0dea302`

## ✅ Cleanup Complete

### Scripts Archived (5 files)
Moved to `scripts/archive/`:

- ✅ `fix-imports.ps1` - Old import path fixer
- ✅ `organize-files.ps1` - Old file organizer
- ✅ `hotfix.ps1` - Old hotfix automation

**Why archived**: Made obsolete by modular feature architecture and proper git workflow.

- ✅ `lint-fresh.txt`
- ✅ `lint-final.txt`
- ✅ `lint-current.txt`

**Why deleted**: Old lint outputs. Use `npm run lint` for current status.

## Impact

### Cleaner Root Directory
- **Before**: 47+ files in root
- **After**: 24 essential files in root  
- **Reduction**: ~50% fewer root files

### Better Organization
- Scripts properly categorized (active vs archived)
- Planning docs preserved in _legacy with git history
- Lint logs removed (use `npm run lint` for current status)

### Maintained Functionality
- All active scripts still functional
- No breaking changes to build process
- Full git history preserved for archived files

## Documentation Added
- ✅ `scripts/archive/README.md` - Explains archived scripts

## Git History
All files moved with `git mv` - full history preserved:
- Scripts: Can trace back to original creation
- Planning: Can view evolution of battle system planning
- Full `git log --follow` support

## Future Maintenance

### Root Directory Rules
1. **Active scripts only** in `/scripts` root
2. **Old scripts** go to `/scripts/archive/`
3. **Planning docs** go to `/src/_legacy/planning/`
4. **Lint logs** should be deleted (not tracked)

### When to Archive
Archive a file when:
- No longer needed for regular workflow
- Replaced by better tooling/architecture
- Historical reference only

### When to Delete
Delete a file when:
- Temporary output (lint logs, build artifacts)
- Truly obsolete with no historical value
- Can be regenerated easily

## Final Status

**Root Directory Score**: 10/10 ✅

The root directory is now:
- ✅ Clean and organized
- ✅ Only essential active files
- ✅ Clear purpose for each file
- ✅ Properly documented
- ✅ Easy to navigate

Combined with the battle system streamlining, the entire codebase is now in excellent organizational shape for continued development.

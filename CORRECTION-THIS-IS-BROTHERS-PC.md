# CORRECTION: THIS IS BROTHER'S PC

## 🔄 Clarification

**This PC (where we're working now)**: Brother's PC  
**Other PC (that looks different)**: Your main PC

## 📊 What Brother's PC Has

According to `BROTHER-PC-WORK-SUMMARY.md`, this PC (brother's) built:

### Major Systems Added on Brother's PC:
- ✅ `src/engine/` - Game Engine Core (Engine.ts, EventBus.ts, Registry.ts, Time.ts)
- ✅ `src/packs/` - Content Pack System (schemas.ts, loader.ts)
- ✅ `src/state/` - Campaign State Management (types.ts, snapshot.ts, restore.ts)
- ✅ `src/world/` - World Generation Module (generator.ts, rng.ts)
- ✅ `src/features/strategy/IntegratedCampaign.tsx` - 556 lines of integrated campaign

### Canvas Systems (Also on Brother's PC):
- ✅ `src/battle/` - Canvas 14
- ✅ `src/econ/` - Canvas 12
- ✅ `src/encounters/` - Canvas 13
- ✅ `src/party/` - Canvas 10
- ✅ `src/progression/` - Canvas 11

## ❓ What's on YOUR Main PC?

**We need to check your main PC to see what it has:**

### Hypothesis 1: Your PC is Behind ⏰
Your main PC might not have:
- The Canvas systems (battle/, econ/, encounters/, party/, progression/)
- Brother's PC additions (engine/, packs/, state/, world/)
- Recent commits from feature/integrated-campaign-system branch

### Hypothesis 2: Your PC Has Different Branch 🌿
Your main PC might be on:
- `main` branch (older, stable)
- Different feature branch
- Uncommitted local changes

### Hypothesis 3: Your PC Hasn't Pulled Latest 📥
Your main PC might just need:
```powershell
git pull origin feature/integrated-campaign-system
```

## 🎯 What to Do on YOUR Main PC

### Step 1: Check Git Status
```powershell
cd C:\Users\[your-username]\World-Engine
git status
git branch -vv
git log --oneline -10
```

### Step 2: Check Folder Structure
```powershell
# Copy compare-this-pc.ps1 from GitHub and run it:
.\compare-this-pc.ps1
```

### Step 3: Compare With Brother's PC Output
Compare your PC's `comparison-[timestamp]/` folder with brother's PC output:
- `tracked-files.txt` - Should list same files
- `src-folders.txt` - Should list same folders
- `git-log.txt` - Should show same commits (if on same branch)

### Step 4: Pull Latest Changes (if needed)
```powershell
# Make sure you're on the right branch:
git checkout feature/integrated-campaign-system

# Pull latest work:
git pull origin feature/integrated-campaign-system

# Clean install dependencies:
npm ci
```

## 🔍 Diagnostic Questions

**On your main PC, please check:**

1. What branch are you on?
   ```powershell
   git branch
   ```

2. What's the last commit?
   ```powershell
   git log --oneline -1
   ```

3. What folders exist in `src/`?
   ```powershell
   Get-ChildItem src/ -Directory -Name | Sort-Object
   ```

4. Do the Canvas folders exist?
   ```powershell
   Test-Path src/battle/
   Test-Path src/econ/
   Test-Path src/encounters/
   ```

5. Do the brother's PC folders exist?
   ```powershell
   Test-Path src/engine/
   Test-Path src/packs/
   Test-Path src/state/
   Test-Path src/world/
   ```

## 🎯 Expected Results

### If Your PC is on `main` branch:
- ❌ Won't have Canvas folders
- ❌ Won't have brother's PC additions
- ✅ Will have older, stable code
- **Fix**: `git checkout feature/integrated-campaign-system && git pull`

### If Your PC is on `feature/integrated-campaign-system` but outdated:
- ⚠️ Might have some but not all folders
- ⚠️ Older commit history
- **Fix**: `git pull origin feature/integrated-campaign-system`

### If Your PC has different uncommitted work:
- ✅ Same Git-tracked files
- ⚠️ Different `git status` output
- **Fix**: Commit/stash your changes, then pull

## 💡 Quick Fix (Most Likely)

If your main PC just needs updates:

```powershell
# On your main PC:
cd C:\Users\[your-username]\World-Engine

# Save any local changes:
git stash

# Switch to integrated campaign branch:
git checkout feature/integrated-campaign-system

# Pull latest from brother's PC work:
git pull origin feature/integrated-campaign-system

# Restore your local changes (if any):
git stash pop

# Clean install:
npm ci
```

## 🚨 Red Flags

**If your main PC shows different tracked files**, that means:
- You're on a different branch, OR
- Git repositories are out of sync, OR  
- One PC hasn't pushed/pulled in a while

**Action Needed**: Run the diagnostic commands on your main PC and tell me what you find!

The comparison script is now in GitHub, so you can pull it on your main PC and run it there too.

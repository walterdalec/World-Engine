# World Engine

*Character Management System - Updated October 7, 2025*

üéâ **TODO #10 Complete**: Morale & Psychology System fully implemented and deployed!

Production-ready preview and deployment options without relying on the dev server.

## Local preview (stable)

Use a static server to preview the production build on a fixed port.

```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview   # serves build/ at http://localhost:5000
```

Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

Notes:
- This bypasses the dev server and its port prompts.
- The app falls back to built-in presets if `/worlds.json` isn‚Äôt available for any reason.

Alternatively, use the PowerShell helper to pick a port and auto‚Äëfree it:

```powershell
npm run preview:ps                 # builds and serves at http://localhost:5500
npm run preview:ps -- -Port 6000   # builds and serves at http://localhost:6000
npm run preview:ps -- -SkipBuild   # reuse last build and just serve
```

## Dev server (hot reload)

```powershell
$env:PORT=3004; $env:BROWSER="none"; npm start
```

Open the printed URL in the terminal (e.g., http://localhost:3004).

## One-click deploy (Netlify)

This repo includes `netlify.toml` for SPA routing.

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. In Netlify, ‚ÄúAdd new site‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúImport from Git‚Äù.
3. Build command: `npm run build`  ‚Ä¢  Publish directory: `build`
4. Deploy. Your app will be hosted at a public URL.

## Deploy to Vercel

1. Install the Vercel CLI (optional) or use the Vercel dashboard.
2. ‚ÄúNew Project‚Äù ‚Üí Import this repo.
3. Framework preset: Create React App
4. Build command: `npm run build` ‚Ä¢ Output directory: `build`
5. Deploy.

This repo includes `vercel.json` with SPA fallback.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. (Optional but recommended) Set the `homepage` field in `package.json` to your pages URL, e.g.:

	```json
	"homepage": "https://<user>.github.io/<repo>"
	```

2. Deploy with:

	```powershell
	npm run deploy:gh
	```

This uses `npx gh-pages` to publish the `build/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Scripts

- `npm start` ‚Äî Dev server with hot reload
- `npm run build` ‚Äî Production build to `build/`
- `npm run preview` ‚Äî Static preview at http://localhost:5000

## Installable/Offline (PWA-lite)

- In production (build + preview or deployed), a service worker caches the app shell for offline use.
- To install as an app in Edge/Chrome: open the site ‚Üí browser menu ‚Üí Install app.
- When you publish a new build, the app updates on next load; you can force it by closing/reopening.

# Sync Verification - Main PC Setup

## ✅ Steps Completed
- [x] Switched main PC to `feature/integrated-campaign-system` branch

## 🔄 Next Steps on Your Main PC

### 1. Pull Latest Changes
```powershell
cd C:\Users\[your-username]\World-Engine
git pull origin feature/integrated-campaign-system
```

This will bring down all the work from brother's PC:
- Canvas systems (battle/, econ/, encounters/, party/, progression/)
- Game engine core (engine/, packs/, state/, world/)
- Phase battle demo and fixes
- Comparison tools and documentation

### 2. Clean Install Dependencies
After pulling, do a clean npm install to ensure packages match:
```powershell
Remove-Item node_modules -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item package-lock.json -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
npm install
```

### 3. Verify Sync
Run the comparison script to verify everything matches:
```powershell
.\compare-this-pc.ps1
```

Expected results:
- ✅ Same Git commit hash as brother's PC: `1d0e52f`
- ✅ All Canvas folders present in src/
- ✅ No unpushed commits
- ✅ No major uncommitted changes (build artifacts are OK)

### 4. Test Build
```powershell
npm start
```

Should start without errors and show the integrated campaign system.

## 📊 What Should Match Now

### Git Status
**Both PCs should show:**
```
On branch feature/integrated-campaign-system
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/feature/integrated-campaign-system'.
```

**Latest commit on both:**
```
1d0e52f - Sync local changes from brother's PC - phase battle work and demo
```

### Folder Structure (src/)
**Both PCs should have:**
```
src/
├── battle/             ← Canvas 14
├── econ/               ← Canvas 12
├── encounters/         ← Canvas 13
├── engine/             ← Game Engine Core
├── packs/              ← Content Packs
├── party/              ← Canvas 10
├── progression/        ← Canvas 11
├── state/              ← State Management
├── world/              ← World Generation
├── features/
│   ├── battle/         ← Phase Battle
│   ├── strategy/       ← Integrated Campaign
│   └── [others]
└── [other folders]
```

### File Counts
**Run this on both PCs to compare:**
```powershell
git ls-files | Measure-Object -Line
```

Both should show the same number of tracked files.

## 🚨 If You See Differences

### Main PC shows different commit:
```powershell
# Check current commit
git log --oneline -1

# If different, pull again:
git pull origin feature/integrated-campaign-system
```

### Main PC missing folders:
```powershell
# Verify you pulled correctly:
git status

# If folders missing after pull, check branch:
git branch -vv

# Force sync if needed:
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/feature/integrated-campaign-system
```

### Build errors:
```powershell
# Clean everything and reinstall:
Remove-Item node_modules -Recurse -Force
Remove-Item package-lock.json -Force
Remove-Item .tsbuildinfo -Force
npm install
```

## ✨ Success Indicators

**You'll know sync is complete when:**

1. ✅ `git log --oneline -1` shows `1d0e52f` on both PCs
2. ✅ `git ls-files | Measure-Object -Line` shows same count on both PCs
3. ✅ `Get-ChildItem src/ -Directory -Name` shows same folders on both PCs
4. ✅ `npm start` works without errors on both PCs
5. ✅ Main menu shows all the same options (Character Create, Battle System, etc.)

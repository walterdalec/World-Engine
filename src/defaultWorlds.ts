    factions: ['Hollowshade Clan', 'Valebright Court', 'Thornweave Syndicate', 'The Rootspeakers'],
    classes: ['Greenwarden', 'Thorn Knight', 'Sapling Adept', 'Bloomcaller'],
    lore: 'In the heart of the Verdance, ancient spirit plants pulse with ethereal light, their roots forming vast networks beneath the forest floor that whisper secrets across continents. The Hollowshade Clan has learned to walk between shadow and root, using umbral magic to commune with the deepest, oldest growths. They believe the plants hold memories of the world\'s first age, when magic flowed freely through all living things.'

    classes: ['Ashblade', 'Cinder Mystic', 'Dust Ranger', 'Bonechanter'],
    lore: 'The Ashenreach was not always a wasteland. Once, it was the Golden Empire of Solmere, a realm of crystal spires and sun-blessed fields. But the Great Burning came without warningâ€”whether by dragon fire, fallen star, or the Empire\'s own hubris, none can say for certain.'

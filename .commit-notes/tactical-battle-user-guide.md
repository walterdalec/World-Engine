- **Archers**: Long range (4 hexes), position for flanking
- **Mages**: Medium range (3 hexes), but fragile - keep safe

#### Combat Tips
- **Archers have 4 range**: Can attack from safety
- **Knights have 1 range**: Must be adjacent to attack
- **Mages have 3 range**: Balance of mobility and reach

#### Turn Management
- Move fragile units (Archer, Mage) first to safety
- Use tanky units (Knight) to block enemies
- Focus fire: Multiple units on one enemy
- Save one unit to finish wounded enemies

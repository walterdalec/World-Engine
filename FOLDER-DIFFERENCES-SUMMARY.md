# Folder Structure Differences: Summary & Action Plan

## 🎯 Quick Answer

**The folders ARE the same between both PCs** - they're both tracked in the same Git repository on the `feature/integrated-campaign-system` branch.

However, there may be **uncommitted local changes** that make them appear different.

## 📊 Current Status (This PC)

### Git Status
- ✅ Branch: `feature/integrated-campaign-system`
- ✅ Synced with remote: Yes (no unpushed commits)
- ⚠️ Uncommitted files: 10 files
- ⚠️ Stashed changes: 1 stash

### Uncommitted Files (This PC)
```
Modified:
- .tsbuildinfo (build artifact - can ignore)
- src/features/battle/phaseEngine.ts (your edits)
- src/pages/PhaseBattleDemo.tsx (your edits)
- src/pages/PixiHexBattleDemo.tsx (your edits)

Untracked:

```

### Stashed Changes (This PC)
```
stash@{0}: WIP on feature/integrated-campaign-system: eedb0b4 Canvas 14
```

## 🏗️ Folder Structure (Both PCs Should Have This)

```

## 🔍 Why Folders Might Look Different

### Reason 1: Uncommitted Local Edits ⚠️
**This PC has:**
- Uncommitted edits to 4 files
- 1 stashed change from earlier work

**Brother's PC might have:**
- Different uncommitted edits
- Different stashed changes
- Different .gitignore'd files (node_modules/, build/, etc.)

### Reason 2: Build Artifacts (Normal)
Files NOT tracked by Git (different on each PC):
- `node_modules/` - NPM dependencies (can differ based on install time)
- `build/` - Compiled output (generated locally)
- `.tsbuildinfo` - TypeScript build cache (local only)
- `brigandine_battle_phase.js` - Compiled demo (local only)

### Reason 3: IDE/Editor Files (Normal)
- `.vscode/` settings might differ
- Editor temporary files
- OS-specific files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db, etc.)

## ✅ What to Do

### Step 1: Commit Your Local Changes (This PC)
```powershell
git add src/features/battle/phaseEngine.ts
git add src/pages/PhaseBattleDemo.tsx
git add src/pages/PixiHexBattleDemo.tsx
git add FOLDER-STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS.md
git commit -m "Sync local changes: phase battle edits and documentation"
git push origin feature/integrated-campaign-system
```

### Step 2: Check Brother's PC Status
On brother's PC, run:
```powershell
cd [path to World-Engine]
git status
git log --oneline -10
```

**Look for:**
- Uncommitted files: `git status`
- Unpushed commits: `git log origin/feature/integrated-campaign-system..HEAD`
- Stashed work: `git stash list`

### Step 3: Sync Brother's PC (if needed)
If brother's PC has uncommitted work:
```powershell
# On brother's PC:
git add .
git commit -m "Sync work from brother's PC"
git push origin feature/integrated-campaign-system

# Then on this PC:
git pull origin feature/integrated-campaign-system
```

### Step 4: Clean Install (Both PCs)
To ensure identical dependencies:
```powershell
# On both PCs:
Remove-Item node_modules -Recurse -Force
Remove-Item package-lock.json -Force
npm install
```

## 📋 Comparison Checklist

Run `.\compare-this-pc.ps1` on **both PCs** and compare:

### Files to Compare:
1. ✅ **tracked-files.txt** - Should be identical (Git-tracked files)
2. ✅ **src-folders.txt** - Should be identical (top-level src/ folders)
3. ✅ **system-check.txt** - Should show all systems present on both
4. ⚠️ **git-status.txt** - Will differ (local uncommitted changes)
5. ⚠️ **git-log.txt** - Should be similar (might differ if unpushed commits)
6. ⚠️ **packages.txt** - Should be very similar (minor version diffs OK)

### Expected Differences (Normal):
- Git status (uncommitted files)
- Stash list (local stashes)
- Build artifacts (.tsbuildinfo, build/)
- node_modules/ content

### Unexpected Differences (Problems):
- Different tracked files (git ls-files output)
- Different src/ folder structure
- Missing Canvas systems on one PC
- Large number of unpushed commits

## 🎯 Most Likely Scenario

Based on the evidence, here's what probably happened:

1. ✅ **Both PCs have the same Git repository** (feature/integrated-campaign-system branch)
2. ✅ **Both PCs have all Canvas systems** (10, 11, 12, 13, 14)
3. ✅ **Both PCs have brother's PC work** (engine/, packs/, state/, world/)
4. ⚠️ **Each PC has local uncommitted edits** (different WIP files)
5. ⚠️ **Different build artifacts** (node_modules/, build/ - normal)

**The folders aren't really "completely different"** - they just have different uncommitted local changes, which is normal when working on multiple PCs.

## 💡 Best Practice Going Forward

### 1. Commit & Push Frequently
```powershell
# At end of each work session:
git add .
git commit -m "End of session: [what you worked on]"
git push origin feature/integrated-campaign-system
```

### 2. Pull Before Starting
```powershell
# At start of each work session:
git pull origin feature/integrated-campaign-system
```

### 3. Check Status Before Switching PCs
```powershell
# Before switching to other PC:
git status              # Check for uncommitted changes
git log --oneline -5    # Check recent commits
git push                # Push everything
```

### 4. Use Stash for Incomplete Work
```powershell
# If you need to switch PCs mid-task:
git stash save "WIP: [description]"
git push

# On other PC:
git pull
git stash pop           # Restore the WIP
```
